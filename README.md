# metro_stop_closure_maps
Automation the generating of helpful signage for Metro Madison bus stop closures. As part of Metro's network redesign, a lot of bus stops will be closed/relocated. This repository contains code to generate pdf files that display useful information for each of the closed stops. The code could be easily adaptable to other systems. The resulting maps are hosted on https://closed-bus-stops.ofmadison.com/

An article describing the project in more detail is forthcoming.
